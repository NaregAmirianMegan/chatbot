Pretty common sight in modding in your early days. Texture file errors are common because games usually still boot up rather than crashing as they are not essential files. Seen similar things when i fucked up hud textures in Fallout New Vegas.

I agree about Kevin Spacey. I'm very conflicted. this isn't going to come out right, but I feel that it's more common in the gay community for younger (maybe not 14) hook ups to occur. He did force himself which is not ok.

It also happens too much where there are not fermatas, but the conductor likes to put them all over the place. Oh man, it's awful. Or where there is a half note that goes for 3 beats, etc. with the awfulness.

Nah that doesn't add up. The Broncos fan base relies on our past glory so we really need to remember back to at least 06 to be true fans
Same. In fact even now with my sumo closing in on 550 I‚Äôm confident I could pull more conventional. It just smokes my back and impacts my squatting and oly lifting where as sumo doesn‚Äôt.

Here we go again with the excuses for bad design.I feel like if any other company made this mouse, no one would make excuses. But yet somehow for some reason, a company who has a history of designing great hardware gets a pass when they don't.

You only add [a little water](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7m3a8b/what_is_your_pro_cooking_tip/drrg1u4/?context=3). I used to whisk my eggs with dairy but somewhere I read about using water. Pretty sure I got that tip from recipes on foodgawker.com.

Funny how apparently we ruined everyone‚Äôs day huh? Just giving info about what happened. Next time this is all we have to say ‚ÄúBroken, Fix it, help.‚Äù And then get yelled at for not sharing enough information

You're not going to get a reply from him as you clearly understood the subtext. And it's going to get a lot worse before people see what he's advocating as even on the table.

Yeah really though, I got kinda spooked when I saw that the video was 18 minutes long like 'Holy shit Leffen lost to non-gods that much this year??' and it turned out to be 70% Plup losses.
Yes

Well it saying yousoro is good enough for me, I shoulda worded my post better.
Tried this a couple of years ago.  Seemed fine at the time but an hour later all the doors and especially the trunk were frozen solid.  I know I could only aim for the tires but still scary to mess with water in cold like this.
Looks like his ankle is messed up again. He was limping pretty noticeably a few plays ago.

Well sorry yes I meant module, thanks for clearing that up. Also Yeah I plan to read through them today, but so far they all look interesting.

Not disputing that, just saying that in his case, if he had a 5th gen or newer i7 it would actually increase his performance.
I think it'd be cool to fit a modern TV into the unit so you could get a nice HD picture with the old school look.
Opposing offensive yards per play are relatively low, but time of possession skews so hard against us that the game averages are higher.Put our exact same defense with the 16th best offense in the NFL and we're a top 10 team.

Listening to the [radio playback](http://radiocapture.com/radio/?view=60OIgJoYZB) the call for medical to be on standby before the shooting occurred was for him to be taken on an M1 hold.
I don't know if I'd call him a kid, I think he's in his late 20's
dont know about that
Better luck next year...
I‚Äôm actually really looking forward to my 30s. I had my daughter at 21, and may not have any more kids, so by the time I‚Äôm in my 30s she won‚Äôt be so young anymore.
Welp
Pretty much!
It's definitely not aggression. The tooth exposure, fin posture, and speed aren't aggressive, anyhow. It's either curiosity or the shark is trying to get water over its gills at a slow speed.
Oh shit did we get Avery Bradley?

Well they could come, too.
Anyone can say, ergo! Okay?!
Yea child abuse.
Happy New Year!!! Now moving on to your question the answer is no, not yet. It is planned for future releases but as of now no.
Aha. No.I was in that bread when it happened
Thanks!
Awesome ! I‚Äôm excited for fedex to get it here already , and I love my crown 3 but I might get the prince tank I want to wait and see some reviews on it though :) the tfv8 looks sick though !
Ass. Or ankle.
It does sort of seem like our 'motivator' head coach isn't able to do much motivating anymore....
It did get good reviews, mainly because the game pandered to idiots who just wanted to get SSS combos without putting in any effort, a camp most critics fall into.

Hahaha, exact comment I was gonna make.
Yeah.
I feel like a lot of people are like you. It's probably in how we approach the medium, I'm not particularly interested in the voices over the visuals I think, so don't give much thought to them.
haha I could argue, but instead I'm giving you an upvote for being brave!
i love you
Disney has said they wanted to move to their own streaming platform, Netflix is more interested in their own content

So like, was there more on your list? I agree with the current list, just wish a couple things would've been different when it comes to the guns *coughs* Argus *coughs*, but they did a great overall job.

I saw your offense today.
I'm not saying Goff isn't attractive too, but Jimmy G looks like he could have made more money as a male model then an NFL QB.

It was a dig at Tapper because he's Jewish.
Yeah, it‚Äôs a scam, he is good
Smash up is lovely
It really is amazing. I kind of wish that the ending wasn't done so quickly but it was still amazing.
Die by the sword
Sure but my point was that he doesn't care about either team winning but about making the right call which is what I thought jimmy was implying
It was the most OK movie I've ever seen in my life
Probably undefeated if we had last year's offense.
Yet he *had* to tweet about that hooker...

The formal logicians of Wittgenstein's era say that all Logic is a tautology, and hence it is beyond the scope of the question to consider if it is rap or not.
Eh. I guess bc I‚Äôm greedy and I like new things. I like having a wide variety of things to choose from. Every brush and razor behaves differently just as almost every soap and splash smell differently.
not every episode has to have a meaning, I still found the episode thoroughly entertaining
How do you 'give up' on a lie? It's exposed as bullshit. You can't just claim you gave up on it. You're a liar now, motherfucker. Didn't apologize for it either, so not a honest mistake
I too accuse women of having tiny dicks when they reject my unwarranted sexual advances.
Dick and asshole!

No, he just means that the overhaul is so extensive that if Nova was  added to Overwatch as a new hero, this is actually what she would look like.Not sure why he doesn't like it. But it does stand out.
This method works!
Goff and Gurley took this season by storm. It will be interesting to see how San Fran builds around Garappolo in the offseason.

And the worst part is that sometimes I‚Äôll blush when there‚Äôs no reason to blush because I‚Äôm scared that if I blush people can see it. Doesn‚Äôt help when it‚Äôs pointed out and that‚Äôs where the fear comes from.

For a little while, my local thrift store had - inexplicably - nothing but seventeen identical copies of Trivial Pursuit.Water, water everywhere. :P
I  miss the old Weekly World News.  The craziest Elvis headline I saw was a report that an amateur astronomer   had spotted him seated in the cockpit of a B-24 bomber that crash-landed on the Moon.  Good times.
Everything is about the 2016 election to you people. It's fucking halarious.You sound like your demented leader.

Not the funniest but the most iconic of his campaign by far. Makes me happy knowing it'll show up on those 'Top Debate Moment' lists long after I'm dead.

I wish I could do art like this. No I found this as a thumbnail on YouTube and then took a photo and cropped out all the unnecessary still.
Yeah, Singapore has some of the best standards of living in the world. And as you say, they're surrounded by developing countries, so of course it's more expensive to buy a suit in Singapore than in Vietnam.  It's a lot cheaper than buying one in Australia though!
If you look close they are pouring out.

Probably the most annoying jerk, in my humble opinion.

Not really useful though because exploiting things like that especially in competitive can get you banned.

I keep my client open anytime I'm on my computer(which is pretty often) and have heard nothing that wasn't associated with a message/notice.

Also, let's hear it for a 10 percentage points rise (125% change) in favor of plural marriage! As a nonmonogamous person, this gives me a little hope.  Only 4 in 5 Americans hate me!

I hope to try them out once I use up some of my stash.  I'm also sampling Buff'd mineral foundation and their olive is REALLY olive.  They have a lot of promising yellow shades too.
And shoutily-sung Auld Lang Syne from another! :D
I agree. I've been following DNA since the ICO and the team is great, transparent, and doesn't hype anything up.
They should just make the next game Battlefield 5 and keep all the work they accomplished on BF4 but with added features like more levolution events, and fully destructible buildings. Throw everything from BF1 out except the map.
