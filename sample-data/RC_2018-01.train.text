Yeah that's where I was. I was working and going to school and I just needed to bring in more money, because at some point saving 50¬¢ by cutting something else out of my already tiny budget just wasn't helping any more.
Better yet, watch the Sonics
An offseason to bulk up a bit could do wonders for him. I don't think he was able to after his college season because of his shoulder injury
At least he still has Liberia on his side.

I only ever see how many minutes/hours/days/months/years old a post is, meaning a post that's 365 days old and a post that's 729 days old are both just marked 'posted 1 year ago'.
GrannyCoins would be a better option. You can only buy them from my grandmother, though, so it's a little bit complicated. You can find her living near Santa Clause. Good luck!
pretty sure the previous rule 7 was the closest.
Trump says something false, Breitbart and Cult 45 lap it up.  Rinse and repeat.

What obscure rule that nobody knows about will overrule the ball starting to move before Landry dropped it?
I mean sure he can't take a hint but people who just stop responding irk me. At least do him the decency of telling him you're no longer interested instead of keeping him on the hook and leading to weird strings of messages like this.
Wait wasn't this what West World was about?
Yea didn't they just smuggle a bunch of baby elephants from Zimbabwe yesterday?
Nonetheless : happy new year. It can only get better from here.
You are not a psycho, only unfortunately short sighted. How old are you? 20? Make another thread when you turn 40 and tell us how much you enjoy your life.
Do what I do and sit at home with ramen noodles and a bottle of cream soda.
Aguero on Luiz last year probably, which was a disgusting tackle aswell with no intent to play the ball.

Why do people think that a fumble? Ground can't cause a fumble right?
Looks like Ronald McDonald decided to donate his shoes.
OP why do you keep going to places that get cold in the winter and then complaining about it? You pulled this same shit in Detroit last week. Do you go to the /r/stove and complain that it's hot when you touch it?

Would be nice in Madden if when you the quarterback runs out of the pocket that the receivers will attempt to run closer to you so you can get the ball out.

Serious question. As someone new to double edge shaving is there any purpose at all in having a collection like this one you have your shave dialed in or is it just a compulsion to always be trying new things?
Yeah, it was absolute shite. Who built the dogs? Why are they hunting people? What the fuck is going on?It was a waste of time.

What is your point? That Singapore is more expensive than neighboring countries? Of course it is, because incomes are higher.The average Singaporean lives more comfortably than the overwhelming majority of the population in neighboring countries, and more comfortably than a huge number of Americans.

I'd say there's a pretty clear difference between the one black centaur and all of the others. She's short and clumsy, and seemingly does all the work for everyone else, while the 'white' centaurs are all tall and graceful and ,seemingly, naturally beautiful.

I don't think the issue is sexualizing something; the issue is with people being afraid of sexuality, of nudity, of the human body.The solution shouldn't be 'stop people from liking this', it should be 'teach people that they're not something to be ashamed of'.
